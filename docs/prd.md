# Security Product Requirements Document
## TPDP Security Foundation & Architecture Enhancement

### 📋 Project Overview
**Project Name**: TPDP Security Foundation & Architecture Enhancement  
**Project ID**: TPDP-SECURE-2024-001  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Framework**: BMAD-METHOD™  
**Timeline**: 6 weeks  

### 🎯 Executive Summary
TPDP currently operates with critical security vulnerabilities including localStorage-based authentication, no real authentication system, insecure session management, and no server-side authorization. These vulnerabilities pose significant business risk including account takeover, data breaches, and compliance violations. This project will transform TPDP into an enterprise-grade TPRM platform with robust security foundations.

### 🔒 Security Vision
Transform TPDP from a vulnerable TPRP platform into a secure, enterprise-grade system that:
- Implements industry-standard authentication and authorization
- Protects sensitive data through encryption and access controls
- Maintains comprehensive audit trails for compliance
- Provides role-based access control for different user types
- Ensures security by design and by default

### 📊 Current Security State
**Critical Vulnerabilities Identified:**
1. **🔴 CRITICAL: Basic Password Protection**
   - **Issue**: Using simple localStorage-based authentication
   - **Risk**: Account takeover, session hijacking
   - **Impact**: Complete system compromise

2. **🔴 CRITICAL: No Real Authentication System**
   - **Issue**: NextAuth.js installed but not implemented
   - **Risk**: No secure authentication mechanism
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data

3. **🔴 CRITICAL: Insecure Session Management**
   - **Issue**: Client-side storage vulnerable to XSS attacks
   - **Risk**: Session theft, privilege escalation
   - **Impact**: Data breaches, compliance violations

4. **🔴 CRITICAL: No Server-Side Authorization**
   - **Issue**: Header-based role detection easily spoofable
   - **Risk**: Privilege escalation, access control bypass
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized system access
