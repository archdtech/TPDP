# TPDP Multi-Developer Branching Strategy

## 🏗️ Branch Structure

```
main (protected)          # Production-ready code only
├── develop (protected)    # Integration branch for completed features
├── feature/*             # Feature development branches
├── hotfix/*              # Critical production fixes
└── release/*             # Release preparation branches
```

## 🔄 Git Workflow for Multiple Developers

### **1. Setup Your Environment**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/archdtech/TPDP.git
cd TPDP

# Setup proper branches
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh setup

# Switch to develop branch for latest integration
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```

### **2. Create Your Feature Branch**

```bash
# Each developer creates their own feature branch
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh feature <your-feature-name>

# Examples:
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh feature authentication-system
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh feature database-schema
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh feature admin-dashboard
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh feature rbac-implementation
```

### **3. Daily Development Workflow**

```bash
# Start your day
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git pull origin feature/your-feature-name

# During development
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement secure password hashing

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push your changes
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### **4. Submit for Review**

```bash
# When your feature is ready for review
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh submit

# This creates a PR to develop branch with:
# - Security impact assessment
# - Testing checklist
# - Documentation requirements
```

### **5. Complete Your Feature**

```bash
# After PR is approved and merged
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh complete

# This will:
# - Merge your feature to develop
# - Delete your feature branch
# - Update your local repository
```

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### **Hotfix for Production Issues**

```bash
# Create hotfix from main
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh hotfix security-vulnerability-fix

# After fixing the issue
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh hotfix-complete

# This will:
# - Merge to main (production)
# - Merge to develop (integration)
# - Delete hotfix branch
```

### **Security Incident Response**

```bash
# Stop all development
# Assess the situation
# Communicate via #tpdp-security-urgent

# If rollback needed:
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Remove last commit
git push --force origin main

# Notify team immediately
```

## 📋 Developer Responsibilities

### **Before Starting Work**
1. **Pull latest changes**: `git pull origin develop`
2. **Create feature branch**: `bash scripts/git-workflow.sh feature <name>`
3. **Check project status**: `bash scripts/git-workflow.sh status`
4. **Run security checks**: `bash scripts/git-workflow.sh security-check`

### **During Development**
1. **Commit frequently** with clear messages
2. **Push regularly** to backup your work
3. **Run security checks** before committing
4. **Follow development guidelines**

### **Before Submitting**
1. **Test your changes thoroughly**
2. **Run all security checks**
3. **Update documentation**
4. **Ensure code follows guidelines**

### **After Submission**
1. **Monitor PR feedback**
2. **Address review comments promptly**
3. **Keep your branch updated**
4. **Be available for questions**

## 🔄 Synchronization Strategy

### **Daily Synchronization**

```bash
# Each developer should sync daily
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# If you have uncommitted work, stash it
git stash

# Update your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git merge develop

# Or rebase for cleaner history
git rebase develop

# Pop your stash
git stash pop
```

### **Conflict Resolution**

```bash
# When conflicts occur during merge
git merge develop
# Resolve conflicts in your editor
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflicts"

# Or for rebase
git rebase develop
# Resolve conflicts
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

## 📊 Project Status Commands

```bash
# Check overall project status
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh status

# This shows:
# - Current branch
# - Remote status
# - Branch list
# - Recent commits
# - Uncommitted changes
# - Open PRs

# Run security checks
bash scripts/git-workflow.sh security-check

# This runs:
# - Secret scanning
# - Vulnerability checks
# - Linting
# - Sensitive file detection
```

## 🎯 Feature Branch Naming Convention
