### **📢 Executive Summary**

A comprehensive security and architecture review has identified **CRITICAL vulnerabilities** in the TPDP project that require immediate attention. The project enterprise architect has initiated a structured improvement project to address these issues.

### **🚨 Critical Security Vulnerabilities Identified**

1. **🔴 CRITICAL: Basic Password Protection**
   - **Issue**: Using simple localStorage-based authentication
   - **Risk**: Account takeover, session hijacking
   - **Impact**: Complete system compromise

2. **🔴 CRITICAL: No Real Authentication System**
   - **Issue**: NextAuth.js installed but not implemented
   - **Risk**: No secure authentication mechanism
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data

3. **🔴 CRITICAL: Insecure Session Management**
   - **Issue**: Client-side storage vulnerable to XSS attacks
   - **Risk**: Session theft, privilege escalation
   - **Impact**: Data breaches, compliance violations

4. **🔴 CRITICAL: No Server-Side Authorization**
   - **Issue**: Header-based role detection easily spoofable
   - **Risk**: Privilege escalation, access control bypass
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized system access
