# BMAD-METHOD‚Ñ¢ Implementation for TPDP Security Project

## üéØ Project Overview

**Project**: TPDP Security Foundation & Architecture Enhancement  
**Framework**: BMAD-METHOD‚Ñ¢ (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI Driven Development)  
**Goal**: Transform security development through agentic planning and context-engineered development

## üîÑ BMAD-METHOD‚Ñ¢ Two-Phase Approach

### **Phase 1: Agentic Planning**
Dedicated AI agents collaborate to create detailed, consistent specifications:
- **Analyst Agent**: Security research and threat analysis
- **PM Agent**: Security requirements gathering
- **Architect Agent**: Technical security architecture design
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Enterprise architect oversight

### **Phase 2: Context-Engineered Development**
Scrum Master transforms plans into hyper-detailed development stories:
- **Full context embedded** in story files
- **Implementation details included**
- **Architectural guidance provided**
- **Eliminates context loss**
