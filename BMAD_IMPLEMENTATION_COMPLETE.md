## üîÑ **BMAD-METHOD‚Ñ¢ TWO-PHASE APPROACH**

### **Phase 1: Agentic Planning**
**Dedicated AI agents collaborate to create detailed, consistent specifications:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Security Analyst: Threat Research"] --> B["Security PM: Requirements Management"]
    B --> C["Security Architect: Technical Design"]
    C --> D["Security QA: Test Strategy"]
    D --> E["Enterprise Architect: Human Review"]
    E --> F["Planning Complete ‚Üí Development Ready"]
```

**What This Solves:**
- ‚ùå **Eliminates Planning Inconsistency**: Agents work from shared security context
- ‚ùå **Eliminates Security Gaps**: Comprehensive threat analysis and compliance research
- ‚ùå **Eliminates Requirements Ambiguity**: Detailed, measurable security specifications
- ‚úÖ **Provides Consistent Security Vision**: All agents aligned on enterprise security objectives

### **Phase 2: Context-Engineered Development**
**Scrum Master transforms plans into hyper-detailed development stories:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Security Scrum Master: Story Creation"] --> B["Security Dev: Implementation"]
    B --> C["Security QA: Testing & Validation"]
    C --> D["Security Scrum Master: Review & Refine"]
    D --> E["Security PO: Gate Approval"]
    E --> F["Security Feature Complete"]
```

**What This Solves:**
- ‚ùå **Eliminates Context Loss**: Full security context embedded in each story
- ‚ùå **Eliminates Implementation Ambiguity**: Detailed technical specifications included
- ‚ùå **Eliminates Security Oversight**: Security validation at each step
- ‚úÖ **Provides Efficient Development**: Clear, actionable development tasks
