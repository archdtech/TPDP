# TPDP Security & Architecture Improvement Project
## Executive Summary & Implementation Guide

### 📋 **PROJECT STATUS: ✅ READY FOR TEAM IMPLEMENTATION**

---

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Project Name**: TPDP Security Foundation & Architecture Enhancement  
**Project ID**: TPDP-ARCH-2024-001  
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL (Security Vulnerabilities)  
**Timeline**: 6 weeks (Phased Approach)  
**Current Branch**: `feature/security-foundation-improvement`  

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED**

### **🔴 CRITICAL: Authentication System Failures**
1. **Basic Password Protection**: Using localStorage-based authentication
2. **No Real Authentication**: NextAuth.js installed but not implemented
3. **Insecure Sessions**: Client-side storage vulnerable to XSS
4. **No Authorization**: Header-based role detection easily spoofable

### **🟠 HIGH: Architecture Deficiencies**
1. **Incomplete Database Schema**: Missing core TPRM entities
2. **No Multi-Tenant Support**: Single organization structure
3. **Limited Audit Trail**: No comprehensive logging
4. **No Proper Relationships**: Database lacks integrity
